"Create a detailed pixel art frame animation for a game, where the final image is divided into multiple sub-images, each serving as a continuous animation keyframe. Design the sequence to depict [a wizard casting a spell: begin with intricate hand motions, then show the wizard conjuring a vibrant fireball, and finally capture the moment of casting the fireball.] Ensure the keyframes transition smoothly and continuously, and include as many frames as possible to achieve a high level of fluidity and detail in the animation."

Replace this part with your character + animation description: [a wizard casting a spell: begin with intricate hand motions, then show the wizard conjuring a vibrant fireball, and finally capture the moment of casting the fireball.]
